# Exercise 0.1 - Sandbox

This is the first programming exercise of this course. In this exercise, you'll familiarize yourself with the development environment.

You should use this sandbox exercise to try out different things later on. When you encounter something new in the material, try it out in the sandbox first, and then solve the exercises on the topic.
